# Production deployment requirements (without heavy ML dependencies)
# These are only needed for embedding generation, not runtime

# Core web framework
fastapi 
uvicorn[standard]
PyJWT
python-multipart

# Database
psycopg2-binary

# Authentication
authlib

# Image processing (basic - advanced features are optional)
Pillow

# Vector search (FAISS - CPU only, smaller than GPU version)
faiss-cpu

# Utilities
requests
numpy
tqdm

# Note: The following are only needed for embedding generation scripts, not runtime:
# - sentence-transformers (only in update_utils/embed_games.py)
# - ultralytics (optional, wrapped in try/except in image_processing.py)
# - opencv-python (optional, wrapped in try/except in image_processing.py)
# - pytesseract (optional, wrapped in try/except in image_processing.py)
# - openai (optional, only if using OpenAI features)
# - replicate (optional, only if using Replicate features)

# Your backend uses pre-computed FAISS embeddings, so sentence-transformers
# is not needed at runtime. It's only used for generating embeddings locally.
